A simple Timer/TimerNotify package to provide timing for Keep Alive pings from the client to the Broker.
Also provide the keepalive packet class used by router to generate the message. 
Both of these are so simple that they could be combined in router but we will keep then here until 
optimisation time.


## Public Types

* [class Ping](mqtt-pinger-Ping.md)
* [class PingReqPacket](mqtt-pinger-PingReqPacket.md)
* [actor Pinger](mqtt-pinger-Pinger.md)
